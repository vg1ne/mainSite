                UX design is all about the usability and experience the user gets when interacting with your app.
                It is UX design that defines the logic of your product, the ways user will be able to achieve his
                goals and key elements that he will take advantage of throughout the process of using the product.

            <p>
                UI design is the visual part of your solution. After UX design is done, itâ€™s time to
                implement its blueprints into colorful screens that the user will see and eventually interact with.
                Thus, the UI designer picks the right color scheme for the product and makes the user interface
                look modern and up-to-date.

    <p class="text-center">
        As both a web development and design company we often build products from scratch.
        While some projects are big and require a huge team, others allow having one designer
        responsible for both UI and UX design. Such wide expertise ensures: our professionals
        are more than competent to implement the best user experience through the awesome user
        interface in the most efficient manner.
